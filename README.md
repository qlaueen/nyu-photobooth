# NYU Photobooth
![Web App build & test](https://github.com/software-students-fall2022/final-project-project5-team2/actions/workflows/web-app.yml/badge.svg)

A fun web app that allows users to share their reactions to randomly generated captionsâ€“ all related to the student life experience at NYU. 

Users can choose to create or not create an account. Those who choose to not create an account will only be able to view other user's posts. Users who choose to log in can view other user's posts, create new posts, and like and comment.
